        <section class="container">
            <p>The Tennessee Department of Agriculture, working with other agencies and non-governmental organization, is maintaining preparedness to respond to disasters. By coordinating the efforts of credentialed responders, as well as registered volunteers,
                the Disaster Animal Response Team (DART) is an integral part of animal disaster preparedness and response.</p>
            <p>The team meets in person to provide trainings for volunteers to respond in disaster situations. Putnam County DART helped to respond to the ice storms in Monterey, Tennessee on February 21, 2015. They also helped in the flooding in Celina, Tennesee
                in February 2019.</p>
            <p>The team participates in events around the Cookeville area, such as "Dogapalooza" and the yearly Pet Expo.</p>
            <p>DART teams began forming after Hurricane Andrew hit the state of Florida in 1992, it was a Catagory 5 Hurricane, the worst of its time, with recorded wind speeds of 175 mph as it hit the Bahamas and South Florida. It wasn’t until Katrina struck
                the Gulf Shores did DART Teams become organized under the Incident Command System (ICS).</p>
            <p>After Hurricane Katrina hit the gulf shores in 2005, and the failing levees in New Orleans called for mandatory evacuation of the local population. As residents prepared for departure, they thought they would only be gone for a couple days,
                leaving their pets behind. Those that attempted to take their pets were told the pets could not go along. By not providing for people’s animals, the people were put in danger as they attempted to return through secure areas to rescue their
                pets. Many pets parished in the flooding and given the huge number of animals displaced from their owners, it was impossible to reunite them all.</p>
            <p>Failing to provide for animal response in a disaster directly threatens human health and safety. This reality led congress to pass the federal Pets Evacuation and Safety Act (PETS) of 2006, which requires states and communities to plan for
                the evacuation of animals as well as people during disasters in order to qualify for federal reimbursement from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).</p>
